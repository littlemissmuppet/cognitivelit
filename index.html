  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Cognitive theory (which is a broad umbrella, encompassing many sub-fields like cognitive narratology and cognitive historicism) 
    grew out of the advances in neuroscience of the 1950s. Scholars from multiple disciplines saw advances in cognitive science as an 
    opportunity to underpin their own fields with scientific evidence. Linguist Noam Chomsky was an early proponent, applying the idea 
    of cognitive science to question Saussurean assumptions about linguistics. Literature adopted cognitive science beginning in the 1980s. 
    Since then, it has been applied to so many varied aspects of literary studies that it hardly acts as a single unified theoretical 
    framework of how to read texts; rather, it mirrors the complexities of literary theory more broadly. What unites cognitive theorists 
    is their attention to scientific insights of how the human brain functions, but the application of these insights has been incredibly 
    varied across the field.</p>
